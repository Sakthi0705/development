CodeMonkey is a fun and interactive approach that teaches the basics of computer science through interactive stories and gameplay. With a step-by-step structure for kids in pre-school all the way to 9th grade, they can progress each year and sharpen their coding skills in preparation for more upper level classes. 

The first couple of years (Pre-K to 2nd grade) focus on block-based coding, while intermediate level classes (2nd to 5th grade) teach text-based coding in CoffeeScript to develop more complex algorithms. More experienced coders (5th to 9th grade) will learn advanced techniques on how to build video games and chatbots that are fully interactive.

Coding is a great hobby for kids to pick up and learn, and if they’ll be using the computer for an extended amount of time, it’s a good idea to think about adding a security software if you haven’t already. If you’re looking for a super easy to use all-in-one package, definitely check out the McAfee Total Protection package. They have a bunch of useful tools and features, such as antivirus software, firewall, password manager, safe browsing and parental controls that are useful if your child will be accessing the internet on your devices. This is a great option for all of your devices.
